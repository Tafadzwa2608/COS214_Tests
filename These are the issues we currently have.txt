These are the issues we currently have
1. I haven't added the latest version of the Observer pattern(as per the recommendation of our tutor)
** 1 isn't that serious
This also means that we will work on it together today.

2. The Mediator, I suggest we wait for the tutor, to approve/disapprove since she said it didn't make sense last time.

3. Then after the demo we do 1 and 2.

4. Lastly we strategically assign each other to committing to the integration branch one last time so that the people with low commits get their numbers up.

5. A draft of the report is there but obviously it's not that impressive.
I sent out invites to a doc that we will use, each of us should type on it and not copy and paste (because they see a live replay if we chat used AI for it)

6. If all goes well we are done nd left with the powerpoint on Thursday.
